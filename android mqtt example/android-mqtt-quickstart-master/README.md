# android-mqtt-quickstart [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bytehala/android-mqtt-quickstart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bytehala/android-mqtt-quickstart)
Android Studio port of the Eclipse paho MQTT sample project.

### Getting Started
1. Download the code `git clone http://www.github.com/bytehala/android-mqtt-quickstart`
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Build and run it.

### Using the Sample App
To test the app, you need an MQTT broker. Luckily, HiveMQ provides a free one which we can use for testing.

### More About MQTT
MQTT is a messaging protocol which has applications in the Internet of Things (IoT).
This sample project uses Eclipse's open-source implementation called the Paho Project.
If you go to the [original source](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java) where I lifted this project from, there are non-Android sample projects that use the Paho library.

### Create Your Own App
(All you need is an MQTT broker)

What you want from this project are the two .jar files inside the `libs/` directory.
If you want to generate your own version of these .jar files, they can be built from source using maven:
https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java

(Honestly, when I made an MQTT app for a client, I just built on top of this sample project.)

### Using Eclipse
There's an Eclipse version available here: https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java
